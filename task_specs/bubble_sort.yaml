  Implement Bubble Sort in Python.
  
  Your task is to write a Python function called `bubble_sort` that takes a list of integers as input
  and returns the sorted list using the Bubble Sort algorithm.
  
  Example:
  Input: [5, 1, 4, 2, 8]
  Output: [1, 2, 4, 5, 8]
  
  Requirements:
  1. The function should be named `bubble_sort`
  2. The function should take a single parameter: a list of integers
  3. The function should return the sorted list
  4. You must implement the classic bubble sort algorithm
